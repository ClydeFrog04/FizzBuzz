# FizzBuzz

This is my collection of FizzBuzz in many languages

## Why?
Because I can :] This sparked from a teammate at work suggesting a slightly different take on FizzBuzz, and I decided to write a java version. From there we wrote c, and I've added the rest since.

## Goal
My goal here is to write a simple well known programming problem in as many languages as I can. This will provide a great way to learn the basics of languages I might not be familiar with, while not needing to focus on solving a new problem at the same time. I can use this to make connections between languages and hopefully build a broader skillset(to a point anyway)

## etc
The solutions might not look special or different, but they are worth looking into to understand why they have been written the way they are. Hope you like them!
